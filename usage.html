             <h2>The Importance of Data Quality</h2>
             <p>The value derived from data is directly tied to its quality. The principle of "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) applies strongly. Poor quality data (inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, outdated) leads to flawed analysis, incorrect decisions, and ineffective AI models. Ensuring data accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and relevance throughout the collection and processing lifecycle is crucial for meaningful usage.</p>

             <h2>Ethical Considerations & Responsible Use</h2>
             <p>While the uses of data are powerful, responsible handling is paramount. This involves respecting data privacy (collecting only necessary data, anonymizing where possible), obtaining proper consent, being transparent about usage, actively mitigating bias in datasets and algorithms, ensuring security, and complying with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA which aim to protect individuals' rights regarding their personal information.</p>
